The protection and conservation of the environment require the commitments of not only Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) but also all of its partners throughout the federal government and provinces, territories, Indigenous peoples, stakeholders and Canadians. It is for these reasons that ECCC emphasizes partnerships. Ensuring effective engagement helps to advance policies, regulations and services, and provides for a coordinated approach to achieve results that are representative of all interests. ECCC is also relied upon to provide science-based environmental information and services so that Canadians may make informed decisions relating to their health and safety.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  There are few major environmental issues for which Canada can find causes or solutions solely within its borders. For this reason, ECCC must engage not only at home but also work with international partners to develop effective solutions to global environmental challenges. The Department seeks to be flexible in order to respond to these challenges and changing circumstances.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Environment and Climate Change Canada is the lead federal department for a wide range of environmental issues. The department addresses these issues through various actions including the implementation of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change; engaging with our strategic partners including provinces, territories and Indigenous peoples; monitoring; science-based research; policy and regulatory development; and, through the enforcement of environmental laws. The department's programs focus on minimizing threats to Canadians and their environment from pollution; equipping Canadians to make informed decisions on weather, water and climate conditions; and conserving and restoring Canada's natural environment.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The department's program focus reflects the interdependence between environmental sustainability and economic well-being.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Under the Department of the Environment Act, the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change extend to matters such as:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The preservation and enhancement of the quality of the natural environment, including water, air and soil quality, and the coordination of the relevant policies and programs of the Government of Canada\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Renewable resources, including migratory birds and other non-domestic flora and fauna\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Meteorology; and\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The enforcement of rules and regulations\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The department delivers its mandate through other acts and regulations, such as the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999), the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act, the Federal Sustainable Development Act, the Species at Risk Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, the Canada Wildlife Act, and the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The department works closely with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and Parks Canada – its ministerial portfolio partners – to achieve many common goals. In addition, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change has secondary or shared responsibility for delivering on other federal departments’ mandates, including the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act (Transport Canada, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, and Natural Resources Canada), the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (Natural Resources Canada), and the Emergency Management Act (Public Safety Canada).\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Please visit our website at:\n  <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n","jobId":"19440","jobLocation":"Toronto, ON, Canada","jobPostingDate":"2024-09-17","jobTitle":"Business Analyst","companyLocation":"4905 Dufferin Street\nToronto, Ontario M3H 5T4\nCanada","numberOfOpenings":null,"positionType":"Co-op","preferredProgramClusters":"Business & Related Programs\nSciences & Related Programs /Environmental Sciences\nMath, Statistics, Economics & Related Programs/Math, Data & Statistical Sciences\nEngineering & Related Programs\nComputing, Information Technology & Related Programs","remoteOnSite":"Hybrid","requiredQualifications":null,"workTerm":"2025 Summer","workTermDuration":null,"workTermDurationOther":null},

Just a few examples of the hundreds of new discoveries made using CryoSPARC:\n  <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26153\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   3D structure of the insulin receptor\n  </a>\n  , critical in understanding diabetes; first-ever\n  <a href=\"https://betakit.com/toronto-biotech-startup-plays-role-in-critical-breakthrough-in-coronavirus-research/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n  </a>\n  in 2020, which was subsequently used for COVID vaccine development efforts; first\n  <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.07.556689v1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   structures of LRRK2 with possible drug candidates attached\n  </a>\n  , a protein heavily implicated in Parkinson's disease.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our foremost aim is to continuously build new algorithms, methods and workflow features that enable scientists using CryoSPARC to make groundbreaking discoveries using the revolutionary technology of cryo-EM. We engage in cutting-edge research, algorithm development, and software development for cryo-EM image data processing. We develop and apply novel machine learning, computer vision and large scale inference algorithms and research to solve the problem of reconstructing 3D structures of biological molecules from cryo-EM data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In this role, you will develop and implement novel algorithms and computational techniques to advance the state of CryoSPARC and the global field of cryo-EM computational methods. Much of the work you will do is at the frontiers of the field, with incredible opportunities for research, learning, collaboration and experimentation. Your code will be deployed to thousands of scientists who will use it daily.  We have been hiring PEY students for several years and they have done excellent work and even gone on to be featured as\n  <a href=\"https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/grads-to-watch-2022/#row11\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   UofT’s Grads to Watch\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What you will do:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Implement and validate computer vision and machine learning (large scale inference) algorithms\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Write stable high performance numerical/scientific code for CPU and GPU\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Perform thorough experiments on real protein data to validate algorithms\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Contribute to advancing CryoSPARC’s capabilities and the state-of-the-art in structural biology and cryo-EM data processing\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Learn about all aspects of what makes a scientific software company work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Learn best practices for software development in an advanced team\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Our technology stack: Python, C, CUDA, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pytorch\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Qualifications:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Structura is the right fit for you if you are a motivated individual who is excited about learning new things, thinking on your feet, and becoming an integral part of a team of talented peers working to create something meaningful.

As a trader, CCI deploys capital on a proprietary basis in the physical and financial commodity markets, providing the Company with market insights and access. As a strategic investor and developer, CCI leverages its market expertise, operations capabilities, and industry knowledge to invest in, and develop, select commodity infrastructure assets. CCI focuses its activities on the markets it understands best, while constantly striving to expand its knowledge base and network of relationships in order to participate in new markets.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  CCI’s natural gas activities include the ownership of physical reserves, physical and financial trading, leasing of storage and transport capacity, and transacting with producers and consumers. CCI’s U.S. Natural Gas business consistently ranks among the top marketers of natural gas in the U.S. transacting on approximately 100 pipelines and over 60 storage facilities to create a geographically diverse portfolio of natural gas assets. CCI’s natural gas storage leases comprise one of the largest independent storage portfolios in North America.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, CCI conducts business from offices located around the world including Calgary, Canada; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Geneva, Switzerland; London, United Kingdom; and Singapore.

This is an ideal opportunity to learn about the commodity markets and more specifically the data impacts that go into the analysis that drives trading decisions.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   Daily/Weekly Responsibilities:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Develop and increase knowledge of the natural gas market\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Design and develop visualizations to analyze fundamental and market data\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Perform natural gas market research and analysis directly supporting trading activities\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Improve existing visualizations to facilitate efficient viewing of data analytics\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Analyze large data sets and build statistical models to identify and forecast patterns\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Partner with traders and analysts to improve trading decisions and research process\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Identify market pricing trends and discontinuity\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Participate in regular meetings throughout the week with traders and analysts\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Example Projects:\n  </strong>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The natural gas market has a number of factors which directly affect the supply and demand balance. These all fluctuate on a daily basis and can result in price changes across the futures curve. Using our fundamental and price data warehouse, build visualization tools to process data and view relationships in supply and demand data.  Interact with traders to determine which relationships have significant market impacts.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Weather is a large driver of price fluctuations in the natural gas market.  It can have an effect on both supply and demand components.  The historical data sets associated with weather are also very large.  Analyze historical weather data and their relationships to natural gas fundamentals across time and regions.  Build visualization tools to view those relationships.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  One key feature in the natural gas market is the existence of seasonality in the term structure of the futures curve.  As a result, many seasonal relationships occur in trading patterns.  Analyze historical relationships between storage and market pricing to find correlations in market activity.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Electricity markets are becoming an important driver of demand for natural gas markets. Forecasting electricity demand from natural gas is becoming increasingly challenging with the proliferation of renewable generation sources (wind, solar) in combination with traditional weather volatility.

NinJo is a mission critical software application, supported 24/7 in forecast offices across Canada and worldwide. The software is written primarily in Java, and is highly configurable using XML.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The NinJo interface uses layer-based visualization of different data types to provide meteorologists with a complete picture of atmospheric conditions. Canada is responsible for several layers including Radar, Lightning, Warning, Hurricane, Satellite and Interactive Graphical Editing (IGE). These components, along with many others, allow meteorologists to create and publish graphical forecast products and text bulletins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   NinJo Forecaster Workstation – NinJo consortium Software Developer\n  </strong>\n  A NinJo software developer will work on the development and maintenance of forecasting and production tools written in Java, primarily on the NinJo client. This will involve working with real users to enhance the NinJo software, either through bug fixes or implementing new features. The NinJo project uses various development tools such as Perforce, Maven, Jenkins, TestLink, and VisualVM to name a few. It also uses various commercial project-tracking tools such as Atlassian Confluence and JIRA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   NinJo Forecaster Workstation – Aviation (TAF) Software Developer\n  </strong>\n  A Software Developer will work on the TAF Editor and related components that support the production of Aviation Forecast for the purpose of flight planning and airport traffic management. This component is built on top of the NinJo platform and relies on the same technologies and processes as other NinJo components like Java, Perforce, Maven, Jenkins, etc. The development process will involve interacting with users for requirement analysis, developing prototypes, testing, and releasing software into production grade environments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Warning Project Renewal - Multiple Roles\n  </strong>\n  Have an impact on the lives and safety of all Canadians. Be part of a small team that develops ground breaking changes to Canada's weather warning system. This project introduces new interactive tools for the forecasters to create and manage weather warning data, as well as new automated processing of that data to generate corresponding public alerts that are distributed to Canadians through various forms of media. Gain experience in Java and Linux while working on interactive features or on back end data processing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Warning Project Renewal – NinJo Weather Event Layer Software Developer\n  </strong>\n  Become a full member of the project’s client side team. Develop interactive editing and production features for a specialized GIS workstation software. The team has an agile process and uses a series of tools for task tracking, code versioning, code reviews, automated builds, and automated testing. Interact closely with our users (forecasters) and with our international partners.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Warning Project Renewal – DMS backend (MWAS connection) Software Developer\n  </strong>\n  Become a full member of the project's backend team supporting the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) Weather Alerting System (MWAS). Develop for a complex backend network of individual Java applications that augment, aggregate and disseminate life saving weather related information to the Canadian public in real time. Information issued from Meteorologists on the client side is reconciled into individual products and disseminated to various clients.
